        <p>When I started with this project, it was a just an idea. I went online to get help with a simple website. My project has developed into a new business for me. My web designer took it to a new level. He explained how things worked with a website, he offered advice and suggestions to take the site to a new level. He worked extremely hard on trouble shooting different issues that needed to be resolved. He remained patient and assured me that everything would work out ok, and it did. I will buy from him again.</p>
